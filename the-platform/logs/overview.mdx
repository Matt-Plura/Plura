<ResponseField name="Timestamp" type="string">
  The exact time when the API call was made
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Request ID" type="string">
  A unique identifier for each API request
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Endpoint" type="string">
  The API endpoint that was called
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Status" type="string">
  The HTTP status code of the response
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Duration" type="number">
  Time taken to complete the request (in milliseconds)
</ResponseField>

### Error Logs
Error logs contain critical information about system issues:

<ResponseField name="Error ID" type="string">
  Unique identifier for each error occurrence
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Severity" type="string">
  Level of error (Critical, Warning, Info)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Error Message" type="string">
  Detailed description of what went wrong
</ResponseField>

## Best Practices for Log Analysis

<Accordion title="Regular Monitoring" icon="chart-line">
  Set up a routine to regularly review logs for:
  - Unusual patterns in API calls
  - Recurring errors
  - Performance bottlenecks
  - Security-related issues
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Error Investigation" icon="magnifying-glass">
  When investigating errors:
  1. Start with the error timestamp
  2. Review related call logs around the same time
  3. Analyze the error context and stack trace
  4. Check for similar patterns in historical logs
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Optimization" icon="gauge-high">
  Use call logs to:
  - Monitor API response times
  - Identify slow-performing endpoints
  - Track usage patterns
  - Optimize high-traffic operations
</Accordion>

## Log Retention and Export
