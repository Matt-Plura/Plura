### **What Are Nodes?**

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a **Workflow** in Plura. Each node represents a specific step in a conversation and has a distinct purpose. Nodes help structure the AI’s behavior by breaking complex interactions into smaller, manageable components.

Nodes are connected through **Decision Triggers**, which dictate the conversation’s flow based on conditions and user inputs. By utilizing different types of nodes, you can guide the AI’s responses, control data flow, and define specific interaction rules to create a structured yet natural conversation.

### **Common Sections Found in Every Node**

Regardless of the node type, every node in Plura AI contains key sections that define its behavior and interaction logic. These sections ensure consistency across workflows and allow for granular control over how the AI operates.

### **1. Node Name**

The **Node Name** is a label that helps identify the node within the workflow. It should be descriptive enough to reflect the node’s function, making it easier to navigate complex workflows.

### **2. Node Description**

This optional field provides additional context about the node’s purpose. It is useful for documentation, helping designers and developers understand its role within the workflow without needing to inspect its configurations in detail.
