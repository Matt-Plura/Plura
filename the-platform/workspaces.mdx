## Workspaces Overview

Workspaces are the central hub of your experience in Plura. They are designed to help you organize, manage, and deploy your AI-powered communications efficiently. Every workflow, AI agent, and phone number belongs to a specific workspace, allowing for clear separation between different projects, clients, or business units.

## What Is a Workspace?

A workspace is a self-contained environment where you can build and manage all of your automation assets. It acts as a collaborative space for teams to:

- Create and manage **Workflows**
- Configure and deploy **AI Agents**
- Assign and maintain **Phone Numbers**
- Monitor and test conversations

Each workspace can contain multiple agents and workflows, enabling you to scale your automation efforts while keeping everything neatly organized.

## Managing Workflows

Within a workspace, the **Workflows** tab lets you view, create, and manage all your AI workflows. These workflows define the logic, responses, and decision-making of your AI systems. They serve as the blueprint for how your AI Agents interact with users.

You can organize workflows into collections for easier navigation and filtering. This is especially useful for separating internal testing flows from live production use cases.

## Managing AI Agents

The **AI Agents** tab is where you build and assign your agents. These agents are the operational side of your workflowsâ€”they handle voice or chat interactions, interpret user input, and execute the logic defined in your workflow.

Each agent can be customized with a voice, behavior settings, call handling logic, and more. Once set up, an agent can be paired with a phone number and a workflow to begin taking calls.

## Navigation and Accessibility

The workspace sidebar makes it easy to switch between core components like:

- **AI Agents**: Create and manage agents that execute workflows
- **Workflows**: Build and organize conversation logic
- **Phone Numbers**: Assign numbers for inbound or outbound communication
- **Live Calls**: View ongoing or recent calls for troubleshooting

This layout provides a simple, centralized interface for everything you need to run and maintain conversational AI campaigns.

## Why Use Workspaces?

Workspaces help you:

- Keep projects organized and separate
- Collaborate with teammates in an isolated environment
- Easily scale your automation as your use cases grow
- Maintain cleaner call flows and deployment processes

Whether you're handling multiple clients, departments, or campaigns, workspaces ensure your AI infrastructure stays structured and manageable.
