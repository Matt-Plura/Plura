## Overview

The **API Call Node** is unique in that it does not include a **Response Setup** section like other nodes. Instead, its primary function is to **send API requests** and optionally process the returned data for use within the workflow.

## API Call Setup

The **API Call Setup** section allows the node to interact with external systems by sending requests and processing responses. This enables dynamic workflows where AI can retrieve, store, and utilize external data in real-time. Calls can be configured to authenticate, structure, and format data according to the requirements of the external API.

### API Call Setup Sections

>**Request Method & URL** – Selects the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) and specifies the API endpoint.
>
>**Authentication** – Defines the authentication method required for the API (None, Basic Auth, API Key, etc.).
>
>**Content Type** – Specifies the format of the request payload (e.g., JSON, Form Data, XML).
>
>**Response Type** – Determines the expected format of the API response (e.g., JSON, XML, plain text).
>
>**Headers** – Allows adding custom headers required for authentication or API-specific configurations.
>
>**Request Body** – Defines the data sent in the API request, applicable for POST, PUT, and PATCH requests.
>
>**Test Request** – Provides a way to test the API call setup before integrating it into the workflow.

### Key Capabilities

- **Send Data** – Forward collected user inputs to an external system.
- **Retrieve Data** – Request and integrate external information into the workflow.
- **Store API Responses** – Extract and save response values for later use.
- **Authentication & Headers** – Configure authentication methods and custom headers.
- **Request & Response Format** – Define the structure of requests (e.g., JSON, form data) and expected responses.

For example, a workflow could ask the user for a **date**, extract that input, send an API request to check **available time slots**, store the response in a variable, and then use it dynamically in the conversation.

## Pre-Request Response

Since this node lacks a standard **Response Setup**, it includes an optional **Pre-Request Response** section. When enabled, this allows the AI to send a message before the API request is executed. This can serve as a buffer message, such as:

  width="600"
  src="/images/pre-request-response.png"
/>

> _"Please wait while I check available time slots for that date."_

The **Pre-Request Response** supports:

- **AI Prompt Mode** – Dynamically generates responses.
- **Static Response Mode** – Sends a fixed, predefined message.

By combining **API calls** with **Pre-Request Responses**, this node enables dynamic, data-driven interactions within the workflow.
