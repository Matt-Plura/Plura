## **What Are Nodes?**

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a **Workflow** in Plura. Each node represents a specific step in a conversation and has a distinct purpose. Nodes help structure the AI’s behavior by breaking complex interactions into smaller, manageable components.

Nodes are connected through **Decision Triggers**, which dictate the conversation’s flow based on conditions and user inputs. By utilizing different types of nodes, you can guide the AI’s responses, control data flow, and define specific interaction rules to create a structured yet natural conversation.

### **Common Sections Found in Every Node**

Regardless of the node type, every node in Plura AI contains key sections that define its behavior and interaction logic. These sections ensure consistency across workflows and allow for granular control over how the AI operates.

## **Node Name**

The **Node Name** is a label that helps identify the node within the workflow. It should be descriptive enough to reflect the node’s function, making it easier to navigate complex workflows.

## **Node Description**

The **Node Description** is an optional field that provides additional context about the node’s purpose. It is useful for documentation, helping designers and developers understand its role within the workflow without needing to inspect its configurations in detail.

## **Response Setup**

The **Response Setup** section defines how the AI generates and delivers responses when it reaches the node. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the AI provides accurate, relevant, and engaging interactions at each stage of the workflow.

This section has two primary response modes, which can be switched using the toggle button above:

> ### **AI Prompt (Dynamic Response Mode)**
>
> In **AI Prompt Mode**, the AI dynamically generates responses based on instructions provided within the node. This mode allows for more natural and adaptable conversations by leveraging AI capabilities to respond contextually.
>
> - **Customization**: You can give the AI specific instructions on how to phrase responses, what tone to use, and how to structure the conversation.
> - **Context Awareness**: The AI can incorporate previous user inputs, external API data, or workflow variables to generate responses dynamically.
> - **Use Case**: Best suited for open-ended interactions where the AI needs to adapt to user input, such as answering questions, handling uncertainties, or engaging in more fluid conversations.
>
> ### **Static Response Mode**
>
> In **Static Response Mode**, the node sends a fixed, predefined message to the user. Unlike AI Prompt Mode, the response is not generated dynamically; it is explicitly written and delivered exactly as configured.
>
> - **Predictability**: The message remains consistent every time the node is triggered, ensuring precise control over what is communicated.
> - **Reliability**: Since the AI does not generate the response, there is no risk of variation, making it ideal for compliance-sensitive messaging.
> - **Use Case**: Best used for structured responses such as confirmations, instructions, and standardized information (e.g., "Thank you for your inquiry. A representative will contact you shortly.").

By choosing between **AI Prompt Mode** and **Static Response Mode**, you can tailor how the AI communicates within each conversation, ensuring flexibility where needed and control where required.

## **Stay Condition**

The **Stay Condition** prevents the AI from moving forward until a specific requirement is met, ensuring critical information is collected or a necessary interaction takes place before progressing to the next step in the workflow. Inside the Stay Condition, you define what must happen before the AI can proceed, and this condition can vary depending on the node’s purpose.

For example, a valid Stay Condition could be: **"Do not proceed until the user has provided their date of birth."** This means the AI will remain in the current node and continue prompting the user until a valid date of birth is received. If the response is unclear or missing, the AI will ask again instead of advancing in the workflow.

Stay Conditions help maintain structured and complete conversations, ensuring that the AI does not skip important steps.
