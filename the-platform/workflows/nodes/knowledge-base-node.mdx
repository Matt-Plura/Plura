## Overview

The **Knowledge Base Node** functions similarly to the **AI Conversation Node**, incorporating all the standard features such as **Response Setup, Decision Triggers, Stay Condition, Data Extraction, Voice Settings, and Behavior Refinement**. However, its key distinction lies in its ability to store and reference predefined knowledge.

## Key Difference: Knowledge Integration

Unlike the **AI Conversation Node**, the **Knowledge Base Node** includes an additional section in **Response Setup** where predefined information can be stored. The AI accesses this knowledge when generating responses, ensuring consistency and accuracy when handling inquiries.

## Use Cases

- **FAQs Handling** – Automatically respond to frequently asked questions.
- **Information Retrieval** – Provide structured answers based on stored knowledge.
- **Support & Guidance** – Offer users predefined assistance on various topics.

<Tip>
  The **Knowledge Base Node** works well with **Global Nodes**, allowing you to set up an FAQ node that can handle general inquiries from anywhere in the workflow without disrupting the conversation flow.
</Tip>

Due to its versatility, the **Knowledge Base Node** is as adaptable as the **AI Conversation Node**, making it a crucial tool for structured AI-driven interactions.
