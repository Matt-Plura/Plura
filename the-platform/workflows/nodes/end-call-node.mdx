## Overview

Aside from the usual node configurations, the **End Call Node** does not include any additional settings. Its sole function is to **end the call and terminate the workflow** once reached. This node is typically used to ensure structured call conclusions, provide a defined exit point in a conversation, or gracefully wrap up interactions with a closing message.

## Functionality

When the **End Call Node** is triggered, the AI agent will:

- Deliver the **predefined response** from **Response Setup** (if configured).
- **End the call** immediately after speaking the response.
- **Terminate the workflow**, preventing any further progression.

This node is essential for structuring **clear, well-managed call flows**, ensuring conversations end naturally and effectively.
