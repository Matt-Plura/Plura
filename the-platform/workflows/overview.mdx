## What Are Workflows?

A **Workflow** in Plura AI is a structured conversational system designed to create a natural conversation while ensuring the AI stays on track. It achieves this by breaking interactions into goal-oriented components, each represented by a **node** with a distinct purpose.

Nodes are linked through **decision triggers**, which control the conversation flow based on predefined conditions. This structured approach helps the AI maintain consistency, ensuring a logical sequence while preserving a natural and fluid dialogue experience.

## Navigating the Workflow

Understanding the workflow interface is essential for building and managing AI-driven conversations effectively. Below is an overview of key navigation components:

- **Nodes Section:** You can browse the available node types and create them either by clicking on the node you want to add or by dragging and dropping it into the workflow.

- **Universal Prompt:** A prompt that is always available to the AI, regardless of which node it is on. It helps guide the call and sets the overall tone of the conversation. ![/images/universal-prompt.png\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/universal-prompt.png)
- **Workflow Control Bar:** The Workflow Control Bar contains essential tools for managing different versions, monitoring performance, and testing workflows. ![images/top-bar.png](/images/top-bar.png)
  - **Version History:** View and select different versions of your workflow to track changes and roll back if necessary.
  - **Create New Version:** Allows you to create a new version of the workflow, maintaining previous iterations.
  - **Analytics:** Provides insights into the performance of each node, helping you optimize conversation flow.
  - **Test Button:** Opens the test bench, enabling you to chat or call the workflow and observe its real-time behavior.
  - **Save & Publish:** The save button saves the workflow changes, while the publish button deploys the flow into either development or production.
- **Navigation Bar:** Contains essential tools for managing your workspace, including undo and redo buttons for easy revisions. ![images/navigation-bar.png](/images/navigation-bar.png)
- **Node Management:** Each node contains three main buttons to help manage and configure its functionality.

  - **Delete Button:** Removes the node from the workflow.
  - **Edit Button:** Opens the node settings where you can configure its behavior.
  - **Node Wizard:** A feature that simplifies node creation by automatically generating prompts, conditions, and other necessary configurations based on minimal instructions.

## Components of a Workflow

A Workflow consists of the following key elements:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Nodes">
    Nodes are the building blocks of a Workflow. Each node serves a unique purpose and helps structure the conversation logically.

    />

    Some of the primary node types include:

    - **AI Conversation Node**: The core node where you provide specific instructions to the AI for handling a segment of the conversation.
    - **Knowledge Base Node**: Enables the AI to retrieve relevant information from a predefined knowledge source.
    - **End Call Node**: Terminates the conversation when a specific outcome is reached.
    - **Transfer Call Node**: Redirects the conversation to a human agent or another department.
    - **API Call Node**: Allows integration with external systems by making API requests to fetch or send data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decision Triggers">
    Decision Triggers connect nodes and dictate the flow of a conversation. Each trigger has conditions that must be satisfied before progressing to the next node. The AI cannot move forward unless the specific condition set within the trigger is met.

    />

    Decision Triggers create dynamic conversations by allowing different outcomes based on user responses. A single node can have multiple Decision Triggers, each activating under specific circumstances, ensuring that the conversation adapts fluidly to the userâ€™s input.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Universal Prompt">
    The **Universal Prompt** is a predefined prompt that remains active throughout the entire workflow, regardless of which node the AI is currently on.

    It plays a crucial role in guiding the call, maintaining context, and ensuring a consistent tone throughout the interaction.

## Why Use Workflows?

- **Consistency**: Ensures that AI follows a structured and logical conversation flow.
- **Modularity**: Allows different parts of the conversation to be broken into manageable segments.
- **Flexibility**: Enables dynamic routing based on real-time inputs and conditions.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates building complex conversational systems without overwhelming the AI with excessive instructions at once.

By organizing AI conversations into Workflows, Plura AI enhances interaction quality, making AI-driven conversations more effective and user-friendly.
