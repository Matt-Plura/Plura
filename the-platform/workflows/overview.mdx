## What Are Workflows?

A **Workflow** in Plura AI is a structured conversational system designed to create a natural conversation while ensuring the AI stays on track. It achieves this by breaking interactions into goal-oriented components, each represented by a **node** with a distinct purpose.

Nodes are linked through **decision triggers**, which control the conversation flow based on predefined conditions. This structured approach helps the AI maintain consistency, ensuring a logical sequence while preserving a natural and fluid dialogue experience.

## Navigating the Workflow

Understanding the workflow interface is essential for building and managing AI-driven conversations effectively. Below is an overview of key navigation components:

- **Nodes Section:** You can browse the available node types and create them either by clicking on the node you want to add or by dragging and dropping it into the workflow.
- **Global Prompt:** A prompt that is always available to the AI, regardless of which node it is on. It helps guide the call and sets the overall tone of the conversation.
- **Version History:** View and select different versions of your workflow to track changes and roll back if necessary.
- **Create New Version:** Allows you to create a new version of the workflow, maintaining previous iterations.
- **Analytics:** Provides insights into the performance of each node, helping you optimize conversation flow.
- **Test Button:** Opens the test bench, enabling you to chat or call the workflow and observe its real-time behavior.
- **Save & Publish:** The save button saves the workflow changes, while the publish button deploys the flow into either development or production.
- **Navigation Bar:** Contains essential tools for managing your workspace, including undo and redo buttons for easy revisions.

## Components of a Workflow

A Workflow consists of the following key elements:

### 1. **Nodes**

Nodes are the building blocks of a Workflow. Each node serves a unique purpose and helps structure the conversation logically. Some of the primary node types include:

- **AI Conversation Node**: The core node where you provide specific instructions to the AI for handling a segment of the conversation.
- **Knowledge Base Node**: Enables the AI to retrieve relevant information from a predefined knowledge source.
- **End Call Node**: Terminates the conversation when a specific outcome is reached.
- **Transfer Call Node**: Redirects the conversation to a human agent or another department.
- **API Call Node**: Allows integration with external systems by making API requests to fetch or send data.

Each node contains three main buttons:

- **Delete Button:** Removes the node from the workflow.
- **Edit Button:** Opens the node settings where you can configure its behavior.
- **Node Wizard:** A feature that simplifies node creation by automatically generating prompts, conditions, and other necessary configurations based on minimal instructions.

### 2. **Global Prompt**

The **Global Prompt** is a predefined prompt that remains active throughout the entire workflow, regardless of which node the AI is currently on. It plays a crucial role in guiding the call, maintaining context, and ensuring a consistent tone throughout the interaction.

### 3. **Decision Triggers**

Decision triggers define the connections between nodes, allowing conversations to progress based on predefined conditions. Each decision trigger can have:

- **Conditional Logic**: Determines which path the AI should take based on user inputs, API responses, or internal variables.
- **Multiple Branching Options**: Enables different conversation flows depending on various criteria.

## Why Use Workflows?

- **Consistency**: Ensures that AI follows a structured and logical conversation flow.
- **Modularity**: Allows different parts of the conversation to be broken into manageable segments.
- **Flexibility**: Enables dynamic routing based on real-time inputs and conditions.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates building complex conversational systems without overwhelming the AI with excessive instructions at once.

By organizing AI conversations into Workflows, Plura AI enhances interaction quality, making AI-driven conversations more effective and user-friendly.
