## Overview

**Universal Prompts** serve as a persistent, system-wide instruction set that shapes how the AI communicates throughout the entire workflow. Unlike node-specific instructions, Universal Prompts remain active regardless of which node is currently being used. These prompts help maintain **conversation style, tone, behavior, and response constraints** across all interactions.

## Key Functions of Universal Prompts

Universal Prompts provide a **foundational guide** for AI responses, ensuring a controlled and predictable conversational experience. They are particularly useful for:

- **Defining AI Identity & Role** – Establishing how the AI presents itself, including its persona, purpose, and limitations.
- **Setting Communication Style & Tone** – Dictating response formality, warmth, professionalism, or neutrality.
- **Providing Response Boundaries** – Controlling what information the AI can or cannot provide.
- **Handling Unstructured Inputs** – Offering guidance on how the AI should react to vague or off-topic user responses.
- **Ensuring Compliance & Data Privacy** – Enforcing response constraints related to security, legal, or regulatory policies.

## How Universal Prompts Work

Universal Prompts act as a **default behavior guide** that influences how AI processes user interactions. They are applied globally and persist **across all nodes**, meaning that the AI follows the same conversational rules no matter which part of the workflow it is currently in.

These prompts can include:

- **General instructions** that dictate how the AI should handle various topics and scenarios.
- **Predefined responses** for frequently asked questions or compliance-related queries.
- **Dynamic conversation strategies** that ensure smooth transitions and prevent AI hallucinations.

## Use Cases

- **Maintaining a Consistent AI Persona** – Defining how the AI introduces itself and interacts with users.
- **Setting Conversation Flow Rules** – Controlling how the AI transitions between topics and handles uncertainty.
- **Regulating Response Scope** – Ensuring the AI only provides information relevant to its purpose.
- **Data Privacy & Security Handling** – Establishing guidelines for responding to inquiries about security and compliance.

## Integration With Workflows

Universal Prompts are particularly effective when paired with **Decision Triggers** and **Global Nodes**, as they ensure that the AI maintains consistent responses across different interaction points. By defining **clear constraints and structured instructions**, Universal Prompts help prevent inconsistencies and improve user experience across all AI-driven interactions.

Universal Prompts serve as a **critical foundation** for AI workflows, ensuring that interactions remain structured, natural, and aligned with the intended purpose of the system.
