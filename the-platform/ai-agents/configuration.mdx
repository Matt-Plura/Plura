# Overview

The **Configuration** tab is where you define the core functional setup for your AI Agent. It allows you to assign workflows and phone numbers that dictate how and when the agent is triggered during inbound or outbound calls.

<Tip>
  Description Field: Use the description field to briefly outline the purpose of the agent. While optional, it is a useful tool for keeping agents organized and making it easier to manage them across large teams or projects.

## Outbound Call Settings

Outbound settings control how the AI Agent handles **outgoing calls**. Here, you can:

- **Assign a Workflow** – Choose one of the workflows available in your workspace. This workflow defines the logic, prompts, and structure the agent will follow.
- **Select a Phone Number** – Assign a phone number that the agent will use to place outbound calls. This is the number users will see on their caller ID.

This setup is critical for deploying campaigns, follow-up calls, or proactive engagement scenarios.

<Info>
  Workflows are the structured conversation paths and logic that determine how an AI Agent should respond and behave during a call. They define the step-by-step flow of interaction, including responses, decision logic, and data handling.

## Inbound Call Settings

Inbound settings allow the agent to handle **incoming calls**. Here, you can:

- **Assign a Workflow** – Just like outbound, you choose a workflow that governs the conversation structure.
- **Assign a Phone Number** – Select the number that users will dial to reach this AI Agent. Once called, the agent will activate and follow the assigned workflow.

This enables inbound use cases like support lines, survey participation, or callback handling.

By configuring both inbound and outbound settings, you define how an agent enters and exits conversations—establishing its functional role within your communication workflows.
