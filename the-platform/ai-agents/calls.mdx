## overview

The **Calls** tab provides a complete record of all calls handled by a specific AI Agent. This view is essential for monitoring agent activity, reviewing past interactions, and gathering insight into performance and behavior. Whether you're troubleshooting an issue or performing quality assurance, this is where you can see every call that passed through the agent.

## Call History Overview

The main list includes:

- **Date & Time**: Timestamp for when the call took place.
- **Direction**: Whether the call was inbound or outbound.
- **From / To**: Phone numbers involved in the call.
- **Interruption Flag**: Indicates whether the user interrupted the AI during the call.
- **Duration**: Total time of the conversation in seconds.

You can search for specific calls by name or filter the list to narrow your focus.
