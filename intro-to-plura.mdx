## What is Plura?

Plura is an AI-first conversation platform built for designing and deploying intelligent voice agents. Whether you're automating appointment reminders, inbound support lines, or outbound lead engagement, Plura provides a powerful and flexible toolset to orchestrate real-time, dynamic conversations.

With an intuitive interface and modular design, Plura enables teams to go from idea to live call with minimal effort—no coding required.


## What You Can Do with Plura

Plura is built for voice-driven automation at scale. Using the platform, you can:

- Create conversational workflows that guide how AI handles voice interactions
- Configure AI agents that act as the interface between your workflows and your users
- Assign phone numbers to agents for inbound and outbound calls
- Test and fine-tune conversations with real-time visibility into decision-making
- Review call recordings, transcripts, and performance insights


## Core Concepts

Plura is centered around three core elements:

>### Workspaces
>
>Workspaces are your organizational containers. They hold everything related to a specific project, client, or use case, including workflows, agents, analytics, and call history.
>
>### Workflows
>
>Workflows define how a conversation unfolds. Built using a visual, node-based editor, workflows include prompts, logic branches, data extraction, and AI responses that determine the flow of each interaction.
>
>### AI Agents
>
>Agents are responsible for executing workflows. Each AI agent is assigned a voice, a set of behavioral settings, and one or more workflows. Agents are also linked to phone numbers, making them ready to handle inbound or outbound calls.
